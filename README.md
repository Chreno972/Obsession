# OBSESSION V.1.0

## History

I'am a man with organization troubles. For many years, I tried to solve that problem many times, by creating Excel sheets, Word or powerpoint sheets, downloaded a lot of applications without nevertheless find a real solution. for every solution i tried, there was always an issue at some point.
With Excel, Word or Powerpoint :
>
> - It was hard to read something on my phone
> - It was hard to write or edit these documents on my phone
> - If someone else wanted to use one of them for his own organization,
> he would have to know how to use Word, Excel or Powerpoint in order to make changes...
> because I've created these documents with my own vision.
> - If I wanted to change something, I had to make it on my computer

With the free applications or free softwares:
>
> - they were usually shielded with lots of features that I didn't need
> - conversely, if I wanted to customize a little bit, I had to pay a premium version.
> At this point I would have what I need + a lot of unneeded features...
> - Sometimes only available on my phone, or not responsive or too expensive...

So I decided one day to use my rising web developpment knowledge to constantly try to overcome my organizational problems.
One of my learning challenges was to create a dashboard, based on multiple YouTube JavaScript tutorials. Once that was done, I immediatly started to make it again and again by myself, in order to finally make this knowledge mine. After that, I had a great idea, I wanted to create something available on every device, something easy to use for everyone something really intuitive with continuous light upgrades. I called this project "Obsession" because from the moment I realized that I had organizational problems. I have constantly
looked for solutions to improve myself. That was my Obession.

## The Project

I tried to make it as simple as possible in a first time. That version 1.0 is only fit for computer users, because I didn't have enough time to do the responsive version due to my school everyday duties.

### Learning Time Accuracy

this data visualization pie chart allows you to visually see the proportion of time you spent studying a specific topic. It's really efficient when you don't have enough time to search or read informations, you directly see what's going on.

---

### Recaps

This section displays the total learning hours, the max learnt topic hours. for the topic values, I created a unit of measurement of knowledge system. 10 hours = 1 lu (learning unit). you need to accumulate at least 20 units to master a topic.

---

### Tasks Manager

It is simply a todolist with which you can create tasks, mark them as done, and delete them.
> the done marker cannot be recorded for now, i'm on it.

---

### The collected data

All the data you give the application, is simply recorded on your local storage. At anytime, you can delete them. On your browser, make a right click, then select "inspect". On the new opened window, click on "application", click on "local storage", you can now delete all your data.

### So that said

Some features may not work on this version.

Finally, this version is just a functionnal prototype. That's why that web application is so ugly. The next version will be made with React and will be really better than this one for sure.
